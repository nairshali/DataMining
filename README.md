## DataMining
# Problem #2 - Classification You are required to build and test a classification model for four datasets:  
1.iris dataset  2.wine dataset  3.breast-cancer-wisconsin.data  4. Zoo dataset


Classification algorithm are required to carry out a comparison of the accuracy (average and standard deviation over 20 trials) of these four evaluation methods for each of the four datasets using the same classification algorithm.  
1. resub: resubstitution error method  
2. hold-out-10%: hold-out method with 10% - 90% partition split   
3. xVal-10f: 10-fold cross-validation method   
4. LOOCV: leave-one-out cross-validation method
